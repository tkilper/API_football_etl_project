Overview
========

Hi! This project is my homemade, locally deployed batch ETL pipeline. It takes soccer data from a free online API (https://free-api-live-football-data.p.rapidapi.com/football-get-list-player), transforms it, and loads it into postgres. There are dashboards built from this data in Metabase located in the metabase/ folder

Programming Languages: Python, SQL, PySpark

Technologies: VS Code, Apache Airflow, Apache Spark, Metabase (Data Visualization), Minio (Datalake), Postgres (Data Warehouse), Astronomer
